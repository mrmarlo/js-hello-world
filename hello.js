/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("I changed the message to What's Up!");
console.log(1);
console.log("Message 1, " + "Message 2");
console.log("Trees are very heavy ");

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? Syntax Error thrown!
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? Syntax Error thrown in each scinario!
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. It will still run. I believe it's because there's only one line of code. 
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other. ?
   7. Print two messages on the same line. Message 1, Message 2 printed! 
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". I couldn't get the qoutes to print!
   9. Other. You choose!
